            <h2>Process</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>First noticed how dark the background is</li>
                <li>Then I saw how it was similar to painting programs</li>
                <li>I proceeded to move my mouse Into the box and left-click </li>
                <li>Realising that it was similar to software I'd used previously, I proceeded to draw a face</li>
                <li>I then move my mouse to the left-hand side of the screen to move the slider up</li>
                <li>After that using my assumed knowledge, I then go back to the page and keep drawing. Sure enough, the thickness of the bush had increased</li>
                <li>Something clicked, and I was thinking I had my dark mode filter on, I went to turn it off, but it was still black. I was somewhat surprised, as not many “painting programs” don't usually have a black canvas and white brushes by default</li>
                <li>The different textures on the top right caught my eye, and I clicked them and played with them by filling in the face</li>
                <li>Making a mistake I reactively pressed ctl z. And without realising it, it just worked</li>
                <li>Then I held alt + scrolled to find I could zoom in (I realised you didn't have to use alt later)</li>
                <li>Zooming in, I coloured in the eyes of the face</li>
                <li>I then began to explore the rest of the site and browsed through the file and image menus</li>
                <li>Proceeding with my curiosity I worked down the page and interacted with everything immediately available</li>
                <li>Finished my (bad) drawing</li>
              </ol>

            <h1>Questions</h1>
            
            <h2>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h2>

                <p>The big black canvas in the middle. I paid attention to the simplistic and bare layout of the page, and the lack of colour.</p>
            
                <br>

            <h2>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h2>

                <p>The canvas itself, drawing on it, erasing, etc.</p>

                <br>

            <h2>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h2>

                <p>Of all things between swapping tools, etc, it was mainly applying whatever tool i was using, that being mostly painting.</p>

                <br>

            <h2>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h2>

                <p>The website presents a very simple, and boiled-down version of a digital painting app. It allows the user to not have to worry about different complex tools or even colours.</p>

                <br>

            <h2>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h2>

                <p>The shape of the website itself resembles a common layout of other digital painting or illustration apps. The lack of tools makes sure that the user knows that they are limited. There is a sense of “just fuck around”. The black background and UI helps push the simplistic theme and is consistent with the styles that you can draw in.</p>

                <br>

            <h2>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time?</h2>

                <p>The large space right in the middle is an obvious immediate calling. Then I assume the user would experiment with different tools, and create some art. From there, there would be the option to save the file for later.</p>

                <br>

            <h2>How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h2>

                <p>In a way, I think it doesn't necessarily suggest an order to experience, other than the big canvas itself, and then the tools next. You could say the slider is a large part of the options, and maybe more people would use that first etc, but I think it's pretty free-form. Then after they are done, the user would probably save their creation.</p>

                <br>

            <h2>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h2>

                <p>It resembles a physical canvas, and the icons are representative of the tools that would be used if this was a physical canvas being painted on. It also replicates a common layout that is used by many other “paint” programs, such as MS Paint, photoshop etc</p>

                <br>

            <h2>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h2>

                <p>Since I am familiar with other programs that are similar to this, the layout and the tool icons etc are already familiar to me. It's intuitive and easy to understand. Even if you hadnt had any experience with this program, the icons represent the equivalent physical media</p>

                <br>

            <h2>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h2>

                <p>I don't feel a pressure to create, or a time limit. There is just what's in front of me. With everything (but a few) options in the open, I know exactly what I have access to, and don't have to worry about going in and out of menus.</p>

                <br>
            
            <h2>What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h2>

                <p>I feel like when I zoom in I would like to have a pixel grid. If I was to do more intricate edits to my work, the grid would make it easier to understand the distance between the pixels</p>

                <br>

            <h2>What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h2>

                <p>The dot style shading was really nice, and I loved how because there is only one colour to paint in, it allowed me to paint over outlines without fear of going over anything.</p>
